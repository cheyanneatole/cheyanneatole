## ðŸ‘¾ Hi, I'm Cheyanne! 
I'm a Cognitive & Brain Sciences and Computer Science student at Tufts University with a passion for blending human-centered design and technology. My projects span full-stack development and machine learning. I enjoy crafting impactful solutions that bridge the gap between technology and user needs, with experience in Python, JavaScript (React, TypeScript), and tools like TensorFlow and scikit-learn. Feel free to explore my repositories showcasing collaborative and individual work! 


### ðŸ’¥ Featured Project: Job Salary Data Configuration 
Check out my work on this data alchemy project for Real Salary! My team and I developed a model to create a job function and industry and sector column for consolidated job posting information, making more clean and usable data for comnsumers.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and model training.
- **What we did**: Collaborated as a team to preprocess raw job posting data, engineered features, and built a machine learning model to classify job functions and industry/sector information accurately. 
- **Results**: Achieved a significant improvement in data usability, with a classification accuracy of 70%. Enhanced consumer trust by delivering cleaner, consistent data and a streamlined interface for accessing detailed insights.
